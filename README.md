# AI Blackjack Game â€“ Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning

This project implements an AI agent that learns optimal blackjack strategies using Monte Carlo reinforcement learning. The agent improves its decision-making over multiple simulations using policy evaluation and improvement algorithms.

## Features
- Monte Carlo RL for Blackjack
- Policy evaluation and improvement
- Training through simulated hands
- Built with Python, NumPy, and OpenAI Gym

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Instructions for running the training and evaluation scripts will be added as the project develops.
